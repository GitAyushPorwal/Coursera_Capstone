As such, the foursquare location platform will be used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API.\n\nThe following data is required to answer the issues of the problem:\n   <ul>\n    <li>List of Boroughs and neighborhoods of Mumbai with their geodata (latitude and longitude)</li>\n    <li>List of Subway metro stations in Mumbai with their address location</li>\n    <li>List of apartments for rent in Mumbai area with their addresses and price</li>\n    <li>Preferably, a list of apartment for rent with additional information, such as price, address, area, # of beds, etc</li>\n    <li>Venues for each Mumbai neighborhood (than can be clustered)</li>\n    <li>Venues for subway metro stations, as needed</li>\n   </ul>\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "<h3>Important libraries used in this project:</h3>\n\nPandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes.\n\nFolium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map.\n\nScikit Learn: For importing k-means clustering.\n\nJSON: Library to handle JSON files.\n\nXML: To separate data from presentation and XML stores data in plain text format.\n\nGeocoder: To retrieve Location Data.\n\nBeautiful Soup and Requests: To scrap and library to handle http requests.\n\nMatplotlib: Python Plotting Module."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
